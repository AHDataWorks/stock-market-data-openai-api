    "In this project we'll use OpenAI's ChatGPT and data analytics to explore the NASDAQ 100 stock market. By the end, we should be able to identify investment opportunities and sector trends through stock price analysis and AI recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Files Overview\n",
    "Our analysis is grounded in two primary data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NASDAQ 100 List (```nasdaq100.csv```): This file contains a comprehensive list of companies within the NASDAQ 100 index, detailing essential information such as company names and symbols. \n",
    "\n",
    "- NASDAQ 100 Price Change (```nasdaq100_price_change.csv```): Complementing our company list, this file tracks the year-to-date (YTD) price changes for each company. This dynamic data allows us to assess performance trends and identify standout performers within the index.\n"

    "1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: We import Python libraries essential for data manipulation, analysis, and interaction with the OpenAI API. This step is foundational, as these libraries provide the tools needed to handle datasets and communicate with external APIs.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **API Key Initialization**: We initialize the OpenAI API key, which is required for authenticating our requests to the OpenAI API. This API key allows us to use OpenAI's capabilities for generating stock recommendations based on our analysis.\r\n",
    "ysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By completing these steps, we ensure that our environment is prepared with the necessary tools and permissions to proceed with the data analysis and integration with OpenAI's\n",

    "1. **Loading Datasets**: We start by reading in two crucial datasets: nasdaq100.csv, which contains information about companies listed in the NASDAQ 100 index, and nasdaq100_price_change.csv, which details the year-to-date (YTD) price changes of these companies.\n",

    "\n",
